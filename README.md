# Voles
Voles are social animals used for behavior studies

Project purpose:
utilizing machine learning for finding insights from complext systems such as behavior, sociology, management, climate, operations, etc.

Introduction
One of the analytical problems that face science, administration, and different work operations is unability of classical analyses* to show obvious difference between the involved factors. Also, in some instances, the difference between the involved factors cannot be handled by classical analyses for producing insight. This project is for utilizing machine learning algorithms to produce insight from the results of classical analyses.

The project includes the following:
1. Real dataset which was generated for behavior study.
2. Classical analyses for different involved factors.
3. Branching out from a result from classical analyses to a machine learning sub-project.

Notes:
classical analyses* include Bussiness Inteligence (BI), descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics.
This page is the hub of branched project. At each step of analyses, the project will branched out (through a link) to a specific machine learning sub-project.
